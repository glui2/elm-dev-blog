## Hey there! I'm Gav.

I've recently been fortunate enough to join the world of Software Development. It's something I've been slowly working towards over the past couple of years, and have finally managed grab hold of an awesome opportunity at a great company.

As a result, I've been encouraged to start logging my learnings and my journey as a dev in a blog. I'll probably throw in some life thoughts as well. And maybe some thoughts about music that I've been listening to. And my keyboards.

...Okay let's just say this will be a "a bit of everything" blog. With a focus on dev.

And of course, Simpsons references.

Hope you get something out of it, and thanks in advance for sussing my blog!
