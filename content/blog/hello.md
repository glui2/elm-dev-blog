Welcome to my blog!

I'm Gavin, a phresh software developer who has just jumped on his first steps into the wonderful world of Functional Programming. I'll be using this blog to document my learnings from time to time, and any cool projects I get around to starting ...and hopefully finishing.

Given that we've been in lockdown for a little while, I'm looking at doing a new mini project every month.
This was basically my first little project for August - I've been thinking about starting a blog for a while (just like every other developer) and what better way to do it than in a new language, Elm! Functional too!

Because I wanted to get it up and running quickly, I leveraged off `elm-pages` and the brilliant starter page that can be found [here](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages-starter). Thanks Dillon for that one!

Yeah I know, I've still got to freshen up the design a bit... September project?

Stay tuned for the next post!

Gav
