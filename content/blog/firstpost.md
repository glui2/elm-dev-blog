My interest in software development only really bloomed over the last couple of years. Like a lot of people who finished high school, I actually had no idea what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I was good at maths... and Japanese. I also have a creative side of my brain, so if there was a magical degree that could blend all these things together that'd be perfect!
So...Engineering has maths...and Arts is kinda creative and lets me study Japanese I guess... so I went in and got me a Bachelor of Engineering (majoring in Electrical Engineering) and Arts. Awesome...except by the end of my degree I still had no idea what I wanted to do. Whilst Engineering was indeed very interesting, I was pretty mediocre at it, especially the low level stuff (how I ever passed Analogue Electronics is still beyond me). The only units I did somewhat decently in were unsurprisingly the more math heavy units, and...coding units, which funnily enough I didn't enjoy all that much at the time.

So what did I end up doing? Basically what every other graduate was doing and applying for any graduate role or program that was available. And I came up with nothing.

At first anyway.

But all praise be to God, after barely missing the mark for the Telstra Grad program, a spot managed to open up in the end and hallelujah - I had a graduate role. I had a JOB. I still remember the moment I had received the call - I was at the gym with a couple of friends. Its amazing how one phone call can feel almost life changing in a sense!

Fast forward to 2018-2020, I made some really awesome friends over 3 years. Thanks to the grad program, I was about to have a taste of software development - one rotation on a backend development team and one rotation where I did mostly frontend developer work. And that's basically when I realised "Yep, software dev is definitely what I want to do." I had realised that perhaps my lack of interest in code during uni wasn't necessarily coding itself but maybe the context or application in which I was coding. Maybe low-level programming wasn't for me, but building web applications, building UIs and APIs - I actually found that a lot of fun. It felt like the blend of creativity and problem-solving that I had originally been searching for when I had finished high school. (Yes, I still kick myself a little for not changing to computer science.)

So knowing this, I spent the next year or so upskilling whenever I had the mental capacity to do so after work (which was maybe a couple of times a week amongst social activities) and honestly it felt like I would never get a role. Rejection after rejection, and the COVID-19 lockdown situation not really helping either I was pretty mentally defeated and honestly felt like giving up.
At which point, I received a call at the end of a Monday afternoon just before I was going into a 4pm meeting which went a bit like this:

- G: Hey! Sorry I'm about to go into a meeting, can I give you a call back?
- HR: Oh ok no worries but this will be really quick because I just wanted to say we're going to offer you a role!
- G: Oh amazing! Thank you so much!
  But really, what I wanted to say was:

## YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS THANK YOU LORDDDDD

I had finally landed my first full time gig, and at a reputable software dev company too! Once again, a simple phone call can really flip your whole year around just like that.

It's been about 4 months already and I've met many passionate and talented software developers here. I'm so grateful to be surrounded by people with so much knowledge and wisdom, who are pushing me and encouraging me to be the best software dev I can be. I'm being pushed out of my comfort zone, and I'm learning stuff that I want to learn and more!

And that brings me to this simple little blog. Thanks for joining me on this journey - looking forward to sharing more thoughts soon.
